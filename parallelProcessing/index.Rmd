I utilize several different methods to improve performance including the parallel computing capabilities that have been developed in the Revolutions analytics version of R.  Below is a table that shows the difference in execution on a MacBook Pro which has 8 logical cores when parallel processing is utilized.  This has a large impact on the ability to test and create models that utilize a large amount of compute capabilities.   My next attempt will be parallel processsing across multiple machines. 

```{r measurePerformance, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)
library(caret)
performanceMetrics <- read.csv("../perform.log",sep = "\t")
performanceMetrics <- performanceMetrics%>%filter(quickRun == FALSE)
performanceMetrics <- performanceMetrics%>%select(-quickRun)
performanceMetrics <- as.data.frame(performanceMetrics)
performanceMetrics$user <- performanceMetrics$user/60
performanceMetrics$system <- performanceMetrics$system / 60
performanceMetrics$elapsed <- performanceMetrics$elapsed / 60

kable(performanceMetrics,digits = 1,caption = "Compute Performance Metrics - in Minutes")
```
